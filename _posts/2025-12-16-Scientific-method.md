## The scientific method steps

### Step 1: Observation and Question

The essence of science lays in the observation of natural phenomena. Upon observing, the scientist shall identify which phenomena is being measured, recognoise patterns, note inconsistencies and dutely document everything. After documenting, questions shall be created. Contrary to popular belief, not all questions are good. A proper scientific question requires 4 values: 
1. Must be clear and specific.
2. Must be testable.
3. Should be relevant to the field.
4. Has to be addressable through research. 

All four points are somewhat open to interpretation, but in essence, the scientific question cannot be overly broad or vague. It should be possible to test it through research, and it should hold some importance for its field.

### Step 2: Background research

Once the scientist has the Questions in mind, it's time to jump onto the literature review. As Newton said, "resting in the shoulders of giants". No individual nowadays can build up centuries of scientific knowledge from scratch, nor it makes sense. As such, it is important, before delving further into solving the Questions, to know what has been previously studied connected to the matter at hand. What are existing theories? What are current debates? are there already established methodologies? are there annual conferences on the topic? Answering these questions can lead to identify where are the gaps in knowledge, as well as properly understand the context in which the research will have to be built in. It is also important, albeit usually ignored, to recoignoise the limitations of the research. Unless the limitations are properly understood, the conclusions can be overestimated, which can lead to false statements, either intentionally or unintentionally.

### Step 3: Hypothesis

It's relevant to distinguish what makes a good hypothesis. There are different characteristics, as well as types.
A good hypothesis will make a testable prediction, with a clear relationship statement, specific variables, and it will be falsifiable. Unless these conditions are met, it will not make a valid hypothesis. 
There are different types, such as the null hypothesis (the effect does not exist), the alternative (the sworn enemy of the null hypothesis), the directional (trying to predict the relationship between variables) or the non-directional (to be used when data contradicts the theory). Which one to choose depends on the situation and problem.

### Step 4: Experimental design



### Step 5: Data collection and analysis

### Step 6: Drawing conclusions
