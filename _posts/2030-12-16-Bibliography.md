## LaTeX and bibliographies
LaTeX is a fantastic tool to write scientific texts. One of its greatests strengths is the ease of use when building bibliographies. In my experience, other tools, such as the Office bibliography manager cannot stand a chance next to the power and ease of use of LaTeX. This may be a personal bias out of habitude, but after years of use, I continue to feel very comfortable with LaTeX. The best guide I have found online for LaTeX bibliography handling is found on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX).

### Bibliography basics
The bibliography building in LaTeX can be divided in three parts ([as all good stories should be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind)):
1. The declaration on the main file.
    On the main file, the bibliography should look similar to this:
    ```
    \bibliographystyle{plain}
    \bibliography{references}
     ```
2. The citations.
    LaTeX provides different tools to create references on the text, such as: 
    - `\cite`
    - `\ref`
3. Text references
4. The .bib file.
