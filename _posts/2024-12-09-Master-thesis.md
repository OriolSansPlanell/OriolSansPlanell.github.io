## Introduction
Writing a Master's Thesis is a very important milestone for every student which, if done right, can positively impact its academic journey. In opposition to other coursework during the Master, the Thesis is a long-term project which requires appropriate planning, dedication, and a strategic approach. With this post I would like to present some tips, tricks and traps I've learned throughout my career, with the hope that someone might find it useful one day. This will not be a complete guide, nor fully exhaustive, as I will complement this work in future posts. Let's dive in.

## Before starting
There are many things to take into consideration when going towards the end of the Master's program. Many of the tips and points I will deliver come from personal experience, and thus may be a bit too "physics-in-Europe-centric". Despite, I strongly feel most of the points can be extrapolated to other fields. 

### Choose the topic
The topic of the Thesis is probably the least important of the three listed in this section, but it is still relevant to find a topic which motivates you, as you will be working on it for some months. 
It is common that either the supervisor or the student itself places an impossible task for the Thesis, be it by lack of knowledge, preparation or accident. It is then important to ascertain the feasibility of the Thesis within the timeframe at hand. If the project is very ambitious, there should be at least some guarantee that results will be produced in time. 
While deciding for a topic, it is also very important to ensure that there is sufficient literature supporting it. The time alloted for a Master's Thesis may be long, but not enough to develop an entire new field.
One last detail to take into account is the expertise of the supervisor regarding the topic. Every Professor's or scientist's research is, to some degree, public. This means that a fast search on databases such as [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) or [Orcid](https://orcid.org/) can give a good idea on the competence of the potential supervisor on the topic.

### Build a good relationship with the supervisor(s)
The supervisor-student relationship is probably more important than the topic of the thesis itself. A good supervision can make for a great Thesis experience, while a bad one can drive the student away from Academia or research alltogether. Some bullet points to help build up a solid supervision environment:
- Schedule regular meetings from the very beginning.
- Prepare clear agendas. Discuss on the current meeting what should be prepared for the next one, set goals and pursue them.
- Take detailed notes during meetings.
- Set realistic expectations regarding feedback.
- Be proactive on the communication. 

## Time to write
This comes as a personal opinion: Start to write as soon as you know the topic of your thesis. Set up the template, structure (even if roughly) the thesis, start filling in the theoretical background as you learn it. There are many things that can be written already at the beginning, and there is no strong reason to wait until the end to write them down. One counter-argument to this approach is that many of the things written at the beginning may end up not being part of the final version of the Thesis. To that, I firmly believe that it is better to have a lot of text and have to trim it down, rather than having to write anew at the end, with all the pressure and deadlines hanging over the head. Let's introduce some resources that may help writing a good thesis.

### Resources
The first and my favorite, is the Latex template (because of course, the Thesis should be written in Latex). There is a fantastic template offered by Overleaf in [this link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-a-masters-slash-doctoral-thesis/mkzrzktcbzfl) and a manual on how to personalise it [here](https://github.com/johannesbottcher/MDT-Quick-Manual). The manual is made by Johannes Bottcher, but sadly I did not manage to find the author of the template.
Related to the first point, Overleaf has a fantastic option on the premium plan, which includes a link to Dropbox. With this, figures made in the computer can automatically be updated in the Latex document in the cloud, creating a very productive 
Next will be bibliographic resources. It is paramount that you organise properly your bibliography, lest you want to get lost in a sea of metadata and references. For this, my to-go resources are [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/). There are different ways to prepare the bibliography on the Thesis, and the different approaches will come in a future post.

### Structure of a thesis
There is a fairly common understanding on how a good thesis should be structured. The same structure, being said, is also found in research papers with minimal alterations: 
1. Introduction
    The introduction should deliver the context and background for the thesis, establish a research question, list the objectives and give an overview on the structure of the thesis itself. The introduction and the conclusions can be written at the end, when the rest of the work is done, as you will have a better outlook on the whole work.
2. Literature review
    What is the current state-of-the-art of the research question? What are key theories or concepts that are necessary to build the project work? Are there any research gaps that you will be trying to fill? These questions should be answered fully in this section/chapter. 
3. Methodology
    The methodology, as the name describes, should include the research approach, data correction and treatment methods and a full disclosure of the analysis techniques. The aim for a scientific document, such as a thesis, is ultimately to enable future researchers to replicate the results, so it is very important for all the methodology to be as well-written and explicit as possible.
4. Results and discussion
    In this section/chapter a clear presentation of the findings should be made. There should be a critical analysis of the results, without including personal biases or opinions. There should also be a connection with the state-of-the-art mentioned in the literature review.
5. Conclusion
    The conclusion presents a summary of the key results, enumerates the implications, both in and outside the field, and presents future research developments that can be done from this point forward to continue the work.

### Common mistakes, professionalism and etiquette
When scrolling through Youtube, you will find a myriad of videos with terrible tips, such as "how to write a thesis in 2 weeks", "how to finish your thesis in 3 days", "how I wrote a thesis in one night while drunk". All this content is pure, destructive noise that does not do any good. Writing a thesis takes time, it requires interaction with other people, self-discipline and dedication in order to have a result that can live up to your future expectations. Do not try to rush it. The master thesis, for many people, is their first interaction with the academic world, and it is important to keep in mind some key elements:
* Maintain academic integrity at all times: 
    If you use some resources, cite them. If someone helps, acknowledge them. Do not try to stab people in the back to obtain better positions. Keep a healthy competition with your peers. Pulling people down to better your position does not help in the long run. If you want to excel at something, the best strategy is to improve oneself every day.
* Be receptive to feedback: 
    Not always the feedback will be positive, and not always the words you will hear will be "great job, keep going". Learn from the mistakes, and improve with negative feedback (there is a whole topic on how to properly supervise and give feedback on a future post). A master's student is supposed to make mistakes, we are not born knowing everything. It is expected that you will fall during the process of learning, and the value resides in being able to get back up and improve.
* Use proper channels:
    Despite the temptation, if you do not have easy access through the University or research centre, you should definitely, never, by any means, use nefarious tools such as SciHub, Libgen or similars in order to access paywall-protected papers and books. It is a bad practice and unless you are using a VPN you have the risk of being caught by some authorities and face consequences for these dodgy acts.

### Self-care
The Master's Thesis is important, but so is self-care. Do not forget that, without a healthy body and mind, it is not possible to deliver appropriate results. For this reason, I want to write a few pieces of advice: 
1. Aim for progress, not perfection (love this one): Writing one phrase in one day is not a failure, it means you will be one phrase closer to completing the thesis. It is not realistic to write 5 pages a day.
2. Set small goals: Baby steps. If the task is "write the whole Thesis", the goal is huge. If instead the goals are divided into sub-tasks, it will be much easier to chew. "correct the chapter", "check the figures", "format the bibliography", "finish the section" are much more doable. 
3. Create a dedicated workspace: Writing a thesis with kids around, or with noise, with meddling roommates, or without a proper table to work is not an optimal setup. Try to create a workspace in which you can write in peace.
4. Find your peers: Humans are social creatures, and the world is big. You are not the only one writing a Master's Thesis. Try to find people nearby doing the same activity. It helps to boost morale to be surrounded by people doing the same thing.

## Conclusion
A Master's Thesis should not be regarded as a sprint, but rather a marathon. As such, the best results will come from disciplined, consistent effort, with careful planning and methodological approach. Do not rush, keep a calm mind, and everything will work itself out. By properly following good practices you will manage to write a Master's Thesis you can be proud of.
