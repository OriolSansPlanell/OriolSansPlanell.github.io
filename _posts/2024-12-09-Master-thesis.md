## Introduction
Writing a Master's Thesis is a very important milestone for every student which, if done right, can positively impact its academic journey. In opposition to other coursework during the Master, the Thesis is a long-term project which requires appropriate planning, dedication, and a strategic approach. With this post I would like to present some tips, tricks and traps I've learned throughout my career, with the hope that someone might find it useful one day. This will not be a complete guide, nor fully exhaustive, as I will complement this work in future posts. Let's dive in.
