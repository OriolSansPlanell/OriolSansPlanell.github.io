# A journey from Master to PhD

As holidays are approaching, and there is some enticing content awaiting for next year, I will write a short post talking about the transition and differences from the Master student to the PhD. 

A master's thesis and a PhD dissertation differ fundamentally in their scope, depth, and purpose. A master's thesis demonstrates mastery of existing knowledge and research methods in a field, typically synthesizing current literature and perhaps adding modest new insights. It usually takes 6-12 months to complete and runs between 40-80 pages. One key note is the fact that the Master Student does not require a publication at the end of the term.

In contrast, a PhD dissertation represents an original, significant contribution to human knowledge. It must identify a gap in existing research and fill it with new findings or theoretical frameworks. This process typically takes 3-5 years and results in a document of 150-300 pages, depending on the field and institution. In recent years, the length of PhD dissertations is getting shorter over time, but a current good estimate, depending on the field, can be found in the following image:

Back to the difference between MSc and PhD, he research approaches also differ markedly. Master's students generally work with established methodologies and theories, applying them to specific cases or problems. PhD candidates must often develop new methodological approaches or theoretical frameworks to address their research questions. Their work requires more sophisticated data collection and analysis, often involving multiple methodological approaches.

The supervision and evaluation process reflects these differences. Master's students typically work with one or two advisors, focusing on proper application of research methods and clear presentation of findings. PhD candidates work with a larger committee and face more rigorous evaluation, including comprehensive examinations and multiple rounds of defense.

Beyond length and time commitment, perhaps the most crucial distinction lies in the expected contribution to the field. A master's thesis should show competent scholarship and understanding of the discipline. A PhD dissertation must push the boundaries of human knowledge, creating new theoretical frameworks, methodologies, or empirical findings that advance the field in meaningful ways.

Happy holidays!
