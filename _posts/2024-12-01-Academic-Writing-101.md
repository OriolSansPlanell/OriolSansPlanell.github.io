## Introduction
There is no widespread standard on academic writing, no "Oxford Academic Scripture Rules" or "World Academy of Science Standard of Writing". What can be found, though, are "best practices" shared by most universities, such as [University of Sourthern California](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/academicwriting), [University of Portsmouth](https://myport.port.ac.uk/study-skills/written-assignments/academic-writing-style) or [University of Melbourne](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/resources/reading,-writing-and-referencing/writing-effectively/academic-style). There are common denominators on each option, which builds a common understanding on how academic writing should be. There are some discrepancies - such as whether it is correct to use personal pronous or it is a capital sin - but overall there is a wide common ground. On this post, first there will be a description on the essentials of academic writing, followed by a couple of sections dedicated to best practices, some tips and things to avoid. Let's get started.

## Core characteristics of academic writing

### Objectivity
The main characteristic of academic writing, which sets it apart from other styles, is a definite claim of objectivity. In order to remain objective, language is important: 
- Detail supporting arguments with concrete evidence and avoid personal beliefs.
- Maintain a neutral and analytical tone regarding the work. 
- Use a third-person perspective, rather than first-person (some debate on that at another, future post).

Regarding the first point: academic writing requires support from previous work. No research being done starts from scratch on every aspect, which means that there have to be references to previous scientific research done previously. Previous studies should support the theoretical background, methodology and analysis of the results. A study supported by clouds and assumptions is not proper scientific methodology, and thus will (should) not be published.
It is common practice, when writing articles, to highlight the positive elements of the work, while disregarding or omitting alltogether the negative aspects. This helps when trying to convince editors and reviewers to publish the work, but on the long run it does nothing but hinder the advance of science. Every work has downsides, and it is important that the authors themselves are the first to recognoise it and highlight the way to improve upon it.

### Formality
It is paramount to maintain a certain degree of formality on academic writing in order to keep professionalism and clarity. For this, the writer should employ discipline-specific vocabulary appropriately. Every field, every topic has its own jargon and it's important to apply it. There are also some important points to keep in mind:
- Colloquialisms do not help with clarity, and the same goes for broad metaphors. 
- It should be obvious that langugae should be as explicit as possible, leaving little room for interpretation.
- Despite using concepts which are obvious in the field, it is important to define them, to stablish a common ground with the reader. 
- It requires a substantial effort, but the authors need to keep an academic tone throughout the document, be it article or thesis.
- Contractions are not only not recommended, they should be avoided completely. 

### Precision
Academic writing requires precision in both syntax and form, in order to appropriately deliver the message. As mentioned in the previous point, it is important to keep true to the field's specific terminology, as well as appropriately defining all the concepts that are being used in the work. It is also important to keep track on all the relevant citations that support the arguments presented, and avoid any vague or ambiguous statements. 
As a spanish writer famously said: "the good, when brief, is twice as good". Academic writing has as a main goal to disseminate knowledge, and help others replicate and build upon the results presented. If the writing is convoluted and unnecessary long, it will not help potential readers to understand it.

## Best practices
There are some key points that can help improve academic writing overall: 
- Ideas should be developed in a logical sequence.
    If a paper starts by talking about the car, and then it describes the functioning of a wheel, just to jump afterwards to how a plane does fly, there might be a little difficulty for the reader to understand how everything links together.
- Claims require support from reliable sources.
    Wikipedia is not a reliable source. Google search is not a reliable source. ChatGPT is not a reliable source. Peer-reviewed, reputable academic journals are reputable sources.
- Counter-arguments should be addressed.
    Every piece of research can have debate associated with it. Doubts may arise over a formalism, or a methodology, or even an unclear conclusion. It is better if the paper already addresses these issues, rather than hiding it for the reader to find out.
- It's good to synthesize information from different sources.
    Science is based on reproducibility. If the same conclusion/claim has been found in more than one peer-reviewed paper, it holds more weight than a hypothesis presented on a preprint in Arxiv.

## Practical tips
Some food-for-thought before ending this post: 
- When writing any academic document, be it a thesis or an article, it helps to start with an outline of the document, to get a clear picture on how to structure it.
- Transitional phrases between sections will help the reader have a smooth sail throughout the document. 
- It is important that the author is the first reviewer of the work, with a keen eye to look for incoherent statements or unsupported claims.
- Academia and scientific advancement is based on collaboration. Peers and mentors can be there to help and give feedback when necessary.
